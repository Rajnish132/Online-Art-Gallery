					Use the gallery price as a starting point. A realistic opening bid is approximately 20 per cent of the gallery price. If there is no such reference, consider a valuation of the artwork.

					A known ‘technique’ at auction sales is to start with a very low auction price to encourage bidding. Do bear in mind this carries a risk: if the winning bid disappoints, the hammer price is binding.
